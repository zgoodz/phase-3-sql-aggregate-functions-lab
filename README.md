## Learning Goals

- Find the min and max of a number set

Run `learn test` to get started. Write your `SQL` in `lib/students.rb` to get the specs in `spec/student_spec.rb` to pass.

Note: Since it's a Ruby file, write your queries as strings inside each method already defined in `lib/students.rb` .
